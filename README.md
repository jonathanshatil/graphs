graph implementations
=========
a graph is a mathematical structure amounting to a set of objects `V` called vertices(also called nodes or points) and set of pairs of vertices that are "related" `E` each of the related pairs of vertices is called an edge (also called link or line)


## adcency list


the most common implement of graph</br>
the graph class contains an array of list of size |`V`|</br>
the list in the nth place reprsent all the vertices which are adjcent(related) to the nth vertex</br>
exmaple:
</br>
![image of adj list example](pictures/adj_list_example.png)</br>
pros using this method:
- getting all the vertices adjcent to a single vertex in O(1) (this method is very usful)
- space complexity of O(E+V) considerd good while  
![image of thin graph definition](pictures/thin_graph_def.png)
- adding edge is O(1)

cons using this method:

- checking if 2 vertices are adjcent is O(n)
- removing edge is O(n)

## adcency matrix
another common way to represent graph is using adjcent matrix - a |V|*|V| matrix
the definition of the matrix:  
![image of matrix defenition](pictures/mat_def.png)  
in case of weighted graph the 1 is replaced by the weight of the edge

pros using this method:

- checking if 2 vertices are adjcent is in O(1)
- getting a specific weight of an edge is in O(1)
- all edge manipilation (adding removing seting) is in O(1)  
- the transpose graph is the graph represented by the transposed matrix

cons using this method

- getting all the vertices adjcent to a single vertex in O(n)
- space complexity is always O(V^2)
- adding or earsing a vertex requires to change the whole matrix

## graph.hpp
graph.hpp contains both graph implementations
the methods that are imolemented in the graph class in the graph.hpp are:

- constractors
- copy constractor
- casting constractor (from matrix graph to adjcency list and vic versa)
- is_adjacent : gets index a and index b and returns if a is adjcent to b
- operator[] : gets index and returns the value of the vertex in this index
- setValue : gets index set the value of the vertex in this index 
- allAdjcents : gets index and return all the pairs of indexes and weights that are adjcent to the vertex in this index 
- adjcentBegin : gets index and return the begining of the iterator on its adjcent vertices and wheights
- adjcentEnd : gets index and return the ending of the iterator on its adjcent vertices and wheights
- is_reachable: gets index a and index b and returns if b is reacable from a
- edgeNum : return the number of edges in the graph
- vertNum : return the number of verts in the graph
- order : gets index and return the number of vertex adjcent to the vertex in this index
- getSubGraph : get a set of vertices and returns a sub graph contains only thos vertcies and the edges betwin them
- getTranspose : return the transpose graph (if in the orginal a was adjcent to b then in the transpse graph b is adjcent to a)
- getUnion : gets onather graph and returns a graph which contains both graphes vertices and edges 
- addNode : gets a value and list of vertices the new vert is adcent to and a list of vertices that are adjcent to the new vertex and adds the vertex to the graph
- removeNode : gets index and remove the vertex in this index
- addEdgeByIndexs : get index a and index b and adds a edge betwin them
- dfsBegin: returns dfs iterator for the 0th place of the graph
- dfsEnd: returns dfs iterator for the end of the graph (defined as -1 index)
- bfsBegin: returns bfs iterator for the 0th place of the graph
- bfsEnd: returns bfs iterator for the end of the graph (defined as -1 index)
